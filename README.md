Individual   Report:
Analysis   of   Audience   Engagement   in   Digital   Media Platforms
Report   BriefOrganisations, groups, brands, and people (e.g., celebrities,   influencers,   politicians,   etc) utilise digital media to engage   and   interact with their audiences   across   multiple   channels and   using a variety of content types.
In this assignment, you will write an analysis of   audience engagement on   a   digital   media   platform.
You will choose the   platform. that is the subject of the analysis   in your   report   and ensure that your report describes and analyses the axes   driving   audience   engagement on the selected platform,   including:
•         The platform’s business or revenue   model(s)—e.g. revenue   streams,   pricing strategy, etc.   If you think it is relevant, particularly   as   it   relates   to   other   axes   of   analysis, you can include details of the historical evolution   of the   platform’s business model.
•         The ownership and governance model(s)—how does the ownership structure   of the platform. and its governance affect audience   engagement   and the   user      experience? The analysis of the platform’s governance can include   any aspect of the platform’s governance that can impact   user experience.   Some   examples   include (but are   not limited to)   moderation policies,   user data   practices, decision making structures related to the development   of featues,   or any other governance choices that you feel are relevant to your   chosen platform.
•         The affordances that the platform. gives to the   users   how   they   affect   and
influence the audience’s behaviour on the platform. You shoud   include   3   to   5   affordances or interface features and how they shape   user   behaviour.
•         The stakeholders participating in the platform   and   their   incentives,   as well   how   these incentives shape the activities and affordances of the   platform.
•          Interactions that are   being   measured and/or monitored on the   platform. You   should   include at least 2 metrics / measures of   interaction   and   how   these measures influence audience   behaviour on the   platform.
•         The ethical and privacy considerations around the   audience’s engagement   on   the chosen   platform. You can include evaluations of benefits   and/or harms/risks to users.
Your analysis should maintain a critical synthesis   and   evaluation   of the   impact of the   above considerations on audience behaviour and engagement   on   the   chosen   platform.
Suggested Writing Structure
Once you have gathered the necessary   information, your analysis should   include   these general sections, but these may differ depending   on   your specific   case:
•          Introduction and background
o   Identify and   introduce the   platform. that is the subject of your analysis
o   Set the scene   by providing   background information, relevant facts, important issues, and outline of the platform’s   history and development.
o   Demonstrate that you have researched the   relevant details of the   platform.
•          Evaluation of the selected axes of   analysis
o   Identify the various axes that you use   in your analysis
o   Evaluate the   platform. in the context of each of these   axes   by

o   Explain   how these axes of analysis complement or conflict with each   other and what positive or negative outcomes they   have for the platform. and its stakeholders, and   in   particular the   users.
•          Recommendations
o   Provide at least 2 specific and realistic   recommendations   and   ideas   to   improve any aspects of the   platform. and its audience’s engagement which you have identified as   not working well.   Explain why these recommendations were chosen, and describe any relevant limitations
o   Support these   recommendations and ideas with solid evidence, such   as:
         Concepts from class (text readings, discussions, lectures)
         Your own research from academic sources
            Personal experiences of platform. users   (anecdotes)
•          Reference: A reference list in   Harvard   Referencing   style.
